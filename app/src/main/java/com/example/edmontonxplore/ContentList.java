But the main attraction of Elk Island National Park is the large herd of buffalo (bison), which graze over a special enclosure.Anyone driving slowly along the road through the park cannot fail to catch sight of one of these massive shaggy beasts. Fun things to do here in the summer include hiking and biking, kayaking and canoeing, as well as camping, while winter activities include snowshoeing and cross-country skiing.The Beaver Hills area has now been designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and includes a dark sky preserve, a bird sanctuary, and a wilderness center. Originally the tribal home of the Sarcee Indians, it was the Cree, however, that hunted the beaver and buffalo for their pelts, which were then traded with the large fur-trading companies.With hunting and settlement, the buffalo were almost wiped out, though some Beaver Hills buffalo are thought to have been captured in 1909 and placed in a reserve of their own. These are the forebears of the animals now living in Elk Island National Park. Address: 54401 Range Road 203, Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta",
